* A shiro-based login page

This is a webapp that offers two URLs for use by the [[http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html][NGINX auth_request module]]:
 - /auth which will just check the login state of Apache Shiro, returning the status code 401 for failure and 200 for success
 - /login which contains a login form and will authenticate against Apache Shiro

The webapp is implemented as two servlets exposed as OSGi services, that will be picked up by the [[http://ops4j.github.io/pax/web/4.x/index.html#_whiteboard_extender][pax web whiteboard extender]].
