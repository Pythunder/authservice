* A shiro-based login page

This is a webapp that is meant to provide forms authentication for use with nginx.  The nginx frontend server will reverse proxy to the login page, and get the authentication cookie set for future access.

All traffic will be redirected via this webapp with a redirect, and the shiro login will determine if the redirect will be affected or not.
